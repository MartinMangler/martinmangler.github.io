# Welcome to my website!

I am a **mineralogist** and **igneous petrologist** based at the University of Southampton. I study tiny crystals to address huge geological challenges. My research focuses on the textures and compositions of crystals to better understand Earth's magmatic processes, including:

- How is magma emplaced and stored in the Earth's crust?
- Why do some magmas erupt while others don't?
- How quickly can we prime a magma reservoir for eruptions? And how can we anticipate the size and style of an eruption?
- How do critical metals become enriched, and how can we find them?

If youâ€™d like to learn more about my past and current research, [click here](https://martinmangler.github.io/research/).

I am also enthusiastic about science communication, public engagement and volcanic risk reduction. [Click here](https://martinmangler.github.io/engagement) to find out more.

For those interested in **crystal shape** and its petrological significance, as well as **quantitative textural analysis** such as **crystal size distributions (CSD)**, I invite you to explore **[ShapeCalc](https://martinmangler.github.io/shapecalc/)**. I developed ShapeCalc as the most up-to-date, robust tool for estimating **3D crystal shapes** from **2D crystal data**.

If you are interested in potential **collaborations**, **PhD projects**, or would like to discuss any research ideas, feel free to [contact me.](mailto:m.f.mangler@soton.ac.uk)

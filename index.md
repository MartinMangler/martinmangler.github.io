# Welcome!

I am an igneous petrologist studying the timescales of magmatic processes leading to volcanic eruptions. My work is focussed on the compositions and textures of crystals in volcanic rocks, which hold unique clues about magma dynamics leading to (1) eruptions and (2) changes in eruption style during ongoing eruptions. Specifically, I use mapping, bulk-rock and micro-analytical techniques, experimental petrology and numerical modelling to explore magma recharge, mush remobilisation and ascent-driven crystallisation dynamics.

The ultimate aim of my research is to strengthen the role of petrology in volcanic eruption monitoring and crisis management. Constraining and understanding pre- and syn-eruptive timescales allows to establish a framework of volcanic behaviour, which can be used to interpret other monitoring signals, feeding into decision-making, planning and preparedness.
